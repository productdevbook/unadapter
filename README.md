## 🚧 Ongoing Development
> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. Features and APIs may change.

This project is based on the adapter architecture from [better-auth](https://github.com/better-auth) and is being developed to provide a standalone, ESM-compatible adapter solution that can be used across various open-source projects.

<details>
<summary><b>📋 Development Roadmap</b></summary>

- [x] Initial adapter architecture
- [x] Basic adapters implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Additional adapter types
- [ ] Integration examples
- [ ] Complete abstraction from better-auth and compatibility with all software systems

</details>

## 🌟 Overview

unadapter provides a consistent interface for database operations, allowing you to switch between different database solutions without changing your application code. This is particularly useful for applications that need database-agnostic operations or might need to switch database providers in the future.

I've seen the need for this kind of adapter system in several of my own projects and across the open-source ecosystem. In the future, better-auth might utilize unadapter, bringing this unified adapter structure to a wider range of open-source projects with full ESM support.
